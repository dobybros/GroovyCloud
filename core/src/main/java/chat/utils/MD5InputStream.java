/**
 * Implements MD5 functionality on a stream.
 * More information about this class is available from <a target="_top" href=
 * "http://ostermiller.org/utils/MD5.html">ostermiller.org</a>.
 * <p>
 * This class produces a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" for
 * all data read from this stream.
 * It is conjectured that it is computationally infeasible to produce
 * two messages having the same message digest, or to produce any
 * message having a given pre-specified target message digest. The MD5
 * algorithm is intended for digital signature applications, where a
 * large file must be "compressed" in a secure manner before being
 * encrypted with a private (secret) key under a public-key cryptosystem
 * such as RSA.
 * <p>
 * For more information see RFC1321.
